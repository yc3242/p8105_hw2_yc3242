I used the tidyverse library through the whole problem set.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

Problem 1
=========

First, I loaded and cleaned dataset for problem 1.

``` r
nyc_data = 
  read_csv(file = "./hw2_data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route9 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route10 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route11 = col_integer(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This NYC Transit data (`nyc_data`) is composed of *line, station name, its latitude and longitude, routes it serves, entrance type, whether or not you can enter the station, presence of ticket vending machine*, and *ADA compliance*. These variables were selected from `NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv` original dataset which was followed by `clean_names()` function in the janitor library. After selecting variables process, `entry` variable was converted from character variable to logical variable. The size of the NYC Transit data is 1868 rows and 19 columns. These data are not tidy because columns are values not variables and there are many duplicated rows.

To remove duplicated rows, I used `distinct()` function as below:

``` r
nyc_data = distinct(nyc_data)
```

The **size** of the NYC Transit data is now 684 rows and 19 columns.

### Questions

**1.1. How many distinct stations are there?**

``` r
nyc_data %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  count()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##       n
    ##   <int>
    ## 1   465

There are **465** distinct stations.

**1.2. How many stations are ADA compliant?**

``` r
nyc_data %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  count(ada)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 2
    ##   ada       n
    ##   <lgl> <int>
    ## 1 TRUE     84

There are **84** ADA compliant stations.

**1.3. What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?**

``` r
nyc_data %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  summarise(mean(entry == TRUE))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##   `mean(entry == TRUE)`
    ##                   <dbl>
    ## 1                 0.385

The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance is **0.385**.

**1.4. How many distinct stations serve the A train?**

To answer the questions 1.4. and 1.5., I reformatted data as below so that route number and route name are distinct variables.

``` r
reform_nyc_data = 
  nyc_data %>%
  gather(key = "route", value = "route_name", route1:route11) %>%  # gather spreading route variables
  separate(route, into = c("remove", "route_number"), sep = 5) %>% 
  select(-remove)
```

And then, I calculated distinct stations serve the A train.

``` r
reform_nyc_data %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name, route_name) %>%
  filter(route_name == "A") %>%
  count()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##       n
    ##   <int>
    ## 1    60

There are **60** distinct stations serve A train.

**1.5. Of the stations that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?**

``` r
reform_nyc_data %>% 
  distinct(line, station_name, route_name, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  filter(route_name == "A", ada == "TRUE") %>%
  count()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##       n
    ##   <int>
    ## 1    17

There are **17** ADA compliant distinct stations serve A train.

Problem 2
=========

I I used the readxl library to read `xlsx` file for problem 2.

``` r
library(readxl)
```

### Mr. Trash Wheel

I read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet as follows.

``` r
trash_data = 
  read_excel(path = "./hw2_data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
                     sheet = 1, range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%                              # use reasonable variable names
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) %>%                            # omit NA data
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)))  # round and convert sports_ball
```

-   The **number of observations** is 285.
-   I think the **key variables** are `month` and `year` since in general, we can analyze the total amount of trash or each kind of trash by them.
-   The **median** number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2016 is 26.

### Precipiation data

I read and clean precipitation data for 2016.

``` r
precip_2016 = 
  read_excel(path = "./hw2_data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
                     sheet = 5, skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%    
  rename(total_precip = total) %>%                    # use reasonable variable names
  filter(!is.na(month) & !is.na(total_precip)) %>%    # omit NA data
  mutate(year = 2016)                                 # add a variable year
```

Next, I read and clean precipitation data for 2017.

``` r
precip_2017 = 
  read_excel(path = "./hw2_data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
                     sheet = 4, skip = 1) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(total_precip = total) %>%                  # use reasonable variable names
  filter(!is.na(month) & !is.na(total_precip)) %>%  # omit NA data
  mutate(year = 2017)                               # add a variable year
```

And then, I combined these datasets and converted month to a character variable.

``` r
precip_data = bind_rows(precip_2016, precip_2017) %>% 
              mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

-   The **number of observations** is 24.
-   In this case, `month` and `year` can be considered as **key variables** since, for example, we can see the trends of precipitation by month and compare the amount of precipitation in years.
-   The **total precipitation in 2017** is 32.93(in).
