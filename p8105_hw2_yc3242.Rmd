I used the tidyverse library through the whole problem set.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```


## Problem 1

First, I loaded and cleaned dataset for problem 1. 

```{r}
nyc_data = 
  read_csv(file = "./hw2_data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```


Write a short paragraph about this dataset â€“ explain briefly what variables the dataset contains, describe your data cleaning steps so far, and give the dimension (rows x columns) of the resulting dataset. Are these data tidy?
